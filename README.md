# Gallery App Readme

Welcome to the Gallery App! This is a mobile-friendly website that allows you to view a gallery of images and access a hidden page.

## Getting Started

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## Usage

- The gallery displays three images, and you can tap on each image to view them.

- If you tap the third image (`Image 3`) three times, you will be redirected to a hidden page called `example.html`.

## Hidden Page

The hidden page `example.html` contains additional content or features that you want to keep separate from the main gallery. You can customize this page to suit your needs.

To access the hidden page:

1. Make sure you are on the main gallery page (`index.html`).

2. Tap on the third image (`Image 3`) three times quickly.

3. You will be redirected to the hidden page (`example.html`).

## Customization

Feel free to customize the gallery by adding more images, changing the styling, or modifying the hidden page. You can replace the image URLs in the `index.html` file and adjust the CSS in the `<style>` tag.
